Panda Attack!

Your Panda caretaker is stuck in the middle of the zoo and he's just run out of bamboo!
Use the floating arrow to shoo the hungry pandas away before they reach the caretaker. If
your caretaker gets bit 5 times before help arrives then you lose! You only need to hold
off the fluffy munchers for 2 minutes, good luck!
