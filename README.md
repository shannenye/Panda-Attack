Panda Attack!

Your Panda caretaker is stuck in the middle of the zoo and he's just run out of bamboo!
Use the fly swatter to shoo the hungry pandas away before they reach him, be careful of
beast pandas; they do 10x damage. Your caretaker starts with 50 health so make sure he
survives until help gets there. You only need to hold off the fluffy munchers for 1
minute, good luck!
